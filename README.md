# ISicily
I.Sicily is a project to build and maintain a TEI-XML EpiDoc corpus of the inscriptions of ancient Sicily. The public data can be accessed through a web interface at http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk.
More information on the project and the data can be found at http://isicily.wordpresscom.
The EpiDoc files in this repository constitute the core public dataset of the project and are subject to continuous update and revision.
